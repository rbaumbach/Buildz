# Advanced Project

This project was created to demonstrate an example of building a static library and dynamic framework using command line tooling.

The static library will be a library of some C++ classes, while the dynamic framework will be a library of some Swift structures.

## Prerequisites

This project will be demonstrating iOS library/frameworks only.

## Static library
